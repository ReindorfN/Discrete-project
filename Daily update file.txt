Should we use Java or python??d This is an interesting question to ask. 

We are yet to decide on that.

The option we'll choose will depend on which language will  make the task relatively easier
and also which langauge has frameworks to easily build GUIs.


Some resources we'll need to get started will be posted here. 

1. 



Date: 18th March, 2024

- The decision to proceed with Java for the project has been made. 
- The GUI for the the program has been developed with room for further improvements.
- One major funcation of the program which is to find the dual of any given propositional logic
has been developed.
- It remains two main functions of the program;
	1. The function to convert a given propositional logic to set notation.
	2. The function to convert a given propositional logic to boolean logic.

- Hopefully, the second major function of the program stands to be completed today.
